This repository explains how to set up a daily-refreshing suspend screen on your Remarkable, based on the text (bible verses, quotes, etc.) you want to display. 
!NOTE!: This tutorial is based on my own Remarkable I. I will not take responsability for any damages to your device which can be associated with following this tutorial.

### Prerequisits
The remarkable suspend screen is a simple .png file which is loccated at /usr/share/remarkable/suspended.png. The image is of dimensiont 1404px by 1872px. To generate images of the upper dimension you need to:

- be able to compile latex files
- convert PDFs to PNGs (I am using ImageMagick here)
